# Covid-19-Tracker
Covid-19 Tracker is an Android App which helps you to track number of cases in different countries available. 
Here I've used https://disease.sh/ open-source API's to display the statistics of each country and also used https://flourish.studio/covid/ a free open-source datavisualization tool to visualize those statistics.
